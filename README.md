ddc-demo: Predicting, visualizing Delhi air pollution
=======

### Summary

4 November 2015. This project will have two goals: to use air pollution data to (1) predict future pollution, and (2) visualize those predictions.

### Resources
* [AirNow (US Gov)](http://www.airnow.gov/)
* [SAFAR - India](http://safar.tropmet.res.in/index.php?menu_id=1)


### TODO

1. ~~Get `git` set up.~~
2. Lit review of existing time-series predictive models for environmental factors.
3. Line chart of past pollution data.
   * `aqi_data_old.dta` to two `.csvs`: full data, only PM2.5 (`aqi_pm25.csv`).
   * ~~Template: IndiaSpend.~~
4. Heat map of pollution around each of the 11 monitors. Which monitors are broken? Which have constant data?
5. ~~Get station geodata.~~
6. `x-axis`: What time scale makes sense? Last week? Month?
